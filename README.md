# Miniproject

This repository contains all the miniprojects for the "Käyttöjärjestelmät ja systeemiohjelmointi" -course. The projects can be found under their own folder, with their own README's with the documentation for each of them.  
  
The implemented projects were Project 1: Warmup to C and Unix programming, Project 4: Kernel Hacking and Project 5: Parallel Zip. Each of the folders contain the projects and individual README's for their usage and documentation.

## Implemented features

Project 1: All features (5 points)  
Project 4: All features except different system call count (4 points)  
Project 5: All features (5 points)  
  
This is just for clarity as to what was implemented and what was not.
## AI declaration
AI was used for assistance with understanding the subjects, but no generated code was copy pasted and where other sources were used I have commented them inside the code.
